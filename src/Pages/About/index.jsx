                                I'm passionate about transforming ideas into digital experiences that tell stories, creating interfaces that not only work but also make sense to those who use them. Between smooth animations, nearly invisible details, and the constant pursuit of simplicity, I believe that technology is more human when it respects the time and attention of those on the other side of the screen.<br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                If you also believe that design and code can change how people feel, then we already have something in common.<br></br>

                                <br></br>
                                And what about me? Yeah... I write code, drink coffee, and enjoy working outâ€”that's already something!
                                <br></br>
